4. Branches are used in Git repositories because when working with a team it is important to be able
to have seperate versions to work on without effecting a stable build. In addition to this, it's a good idea
to seperate features until client approval is recieved so as to keep a proper version on hand.
5. git log displays commit history, git status displays information about the working directory.
6. git log Vehicle.h
7. git log --grep="file"
9. Integration vs Dictator and Lieutenant- Integration focuses on everyone making public changes in their own
branch which can then be integrated by the integration manager in the central repository, while Dictator
and Lieutenant relies on a central repository that everyone draws from and changes have to be made through
the Lieutenant, which the Dictator has the final say in.
10. Dictator and Lieutenants workflow is a great deal more organized than the centralized workflow, and
with many individuals working on one project, would be the preferable way to go. Higher pool of individuals means
higher chances for messups, and one doesn't want to have a broken program pushed to the central repository.
